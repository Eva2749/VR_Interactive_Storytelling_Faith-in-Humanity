# Project Description
### Inspiration and Questions to Explore
Our project is inspired by the popular science fiction novel *The Three-Body Problem*, whose plot focuses on extraterrestrial forces that are trying to destroy Earth. Our take on it, however, was not to replicate the storyline nor the idea itself but rather zoom into the people aspect of the story. How would different people react when they realize that everything would collapse? What's the best direction for humans to go and who we should be listening to? As the player, you'll be enrountering various groups of interest and be left with the decision to decide the future of the human beings. What decision will you make? Is that a right choice? 

We twisted the story background a little bit to intensify the moral problem. The main character is a prestigious inventor who has the supermacy to determine humans' future. Faced with a dying Earth and the invitation from an unknown extraterrestrial, the inventor is left with a moral question - should we trust the aliens and select a group of human elites to join them? Or should we reject the aliens' invitation and stay on the planet, which is doomed to death? Either decision would lead to huge loss of humans' life and with little hope. It's a gamble. 

### User Experience
Our goal is to create a playable experience through which the player would interact with people with different points of views in terms of the future of the dying Earth, before the player makes the final decision. The core experience is focused on immersive storytelling through character building and environmental building, so the majority of the efforts is dedicated to ensuring a linear and progressive interaction sequence. 

# My Work
## Scene 3 - The Lab

### Background
The lab scene is the player’s first encounter with the group of interest — the scientists. The inventor/player would be greeted by the representative of the scientist group - Joseph, who is also her friend. Joseph would show the hyper-growth concept to the inventor in an attempt to persuade the inventor into supporting the scientists.

### Interactions Sequence

- Greeted by Joseph: when the inventor enters the lab, Joseph would come over and greet her
- Follow Joseph and see him talking: after greeting, Joseph would ask the user to follow him over to the lab table. When the user comes, Joseph would introduce her to the concept of hyper-growth.
- Pour the bottle: Joseph would instruct the inventor to pick up the yellow bottle on the table and pour it inside the blue container on the robot's hand.
- See the plant grow: after the inventor successfully pours into the blue container, the inventor would see a pump transferring the yellow chemicals into the tube, and the plant will grow.
- Respond to Joseph: after the inventor sees the plant growing quickly, Joseph will ask her if such an effect has changed her mind. Then a UI would appear asking the inventor to respond (has two options). Joseph would respond accordingly.
- Leave the lab: the inventor received enough information and would like to take a walk outside to clear her head. Joseph would say goodbye to her and the inventor would go to the teleport portal and teleport to the outside world.
