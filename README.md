# Project Description
### Inspiration and Questions to Explore
Our project is inspired by the popular science fiction novel *The Three-Body Problem*, whose plot focuses on extraterrestrial forces that are trying to destroy Earth. Our take on it, however, was not to replicate the storyline nor the idea itself but rather zoom into the people aspect of the story. How would different people react when they realize that everything would collapse? What's the best direction for humans to go and who we should be listening to? As the player, you'll be enrountering various groups of interest and be left with the decision to decide the future of the human beings. What decision will you make? Is that a right choice? 

### User Experience
Our goal was to create a playable experience through which the user goes through the motions of meeting and interacting with these waves of people knowing that their futures rested on their shoulders.

### Background
The lab scene is the player’s first encounter with the group of interest — the scientists. The inventor would be greeted by the representative of the scientist group - Joseph, who is also her friend. Joseph would show the hyper-growth concept to the inventor in an attempt to persuade the inventor into supporting the scientists.
